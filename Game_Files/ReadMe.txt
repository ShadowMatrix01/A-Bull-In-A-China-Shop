<h1>Version (Pre-Release): 1.0.3  <br>
<h1>Purpose: To make a fun game in PyGame that also demonstrates my understanding of python such as libraries, loops, conditionals, branching, front-end graphics, back-end code, and more.  <br>
<h1>DONE: Bull movement across the x axis, bull drawing, item spawning and respawning logic, points accumulated.  <br>
<h1>To-Draw, draw sprites, store, item, the three phases, and environmental hazards , story, ground, restart loop, splash screen, player jumping. <br>
<h1>To-Do and IDEAS:  <br>
<h2>Every 20 seconds, a third of the shop gets destroyed, which is why you must get all of the item before the time runs out  <br>
<h2>HAZARD: Maybe, if you aren't careful, and say you get accidentally covered by red cape, he charges towards you for 3 seconds!  <br>
<h2>If the bull collides with the item, he takes it, and you have 3 seconds to get it back from him, which you can do by jumping on him!  <br>
<h2>If they run out of time and do not get the item back safely, 6 seconds per 1 item, they get a game over screen showing their final score.  <br>
<h2>After everything is done, consider adding hazards such as falling debris, pool of water across the x axis (if you collide with it you move slower and so does the bull!), paint, etc  <br>
<h2>Animation for background needed!  <br>
<h2>Game over screen, for 6/24!  <br>
<h2> Fixed item spawning to not go off screen.
<h2> Fixed transparency on image, had to change starting y position
<h2> HAZARD: WATER PIPES ON THE BOTTOM WILL SHOOT OUU WATER PROJECTILES FROM BOTTOM TO TOP, IF THE PLAYER TOUCHES IT, THE WILL GET 1 LIFE REDUCED (TOTAL 3). Gravity from bottom to top, and drawing said pipes.
<h1>[TOOL] A freeze in place, freezes everything except for the player and the item, but only for 3 seconds. Make sound play when pipe is about to blast out water
